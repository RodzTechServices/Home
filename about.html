            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h3>My Mission</h3>
            <p>Rodz Tech is a platform dedicated to the art and science of PC building and modding. My mission is to share my experiences and insights, from discovering new technologies to exploring the latest in PC modding innovations. I believe in the power of knowledge to transform the way enthusiasts approach technology.</p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I first discovered modding while playing on my Xbox 360, particularly with games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2. I was fascinated by the idea of hacking the game to unlock everything, which led me to explore modding communities such as TTG and Se7ensins. This initial exposure to modding sparked my interest in not just unlocking content but also in the broader world of performance modding.As I delved deeper into modding, I began to appreciate the technical side of enhancing performance. However, my interest in modding took a significant turn when the Xbox Series X was announced. The lack of user upgrade options, especially compared to the PS5's ability to easily add an aftermarket SSD, made me realize the limitations of consoles. This prompted me to make the switch to PC. Building my own PC allowed me to fully customize and optimize my setup, and from then on, I never looked back. It was the perfect intersection of my passion for modding and my desire for performance optimization.</p>

            <h3>My View on Prebuilt PCs</h3>
            <p>I noticed that prebuilt sellers frequently attach substantial price tags to their computers and services. However, with the proper knowledge and dedication, one can replicate these prebuilt PCs at a substantial discount by sourcing and assembling the components independently. This realization led me to delve deeper into the evolving PC modding market, which has transitioned from a niche DIY endeavor fraught with risks to a landscape where readily available off-the-shelf components can deliver significant performance enhancements. This shift not only democratizes access to high-performance computing but also empowers enthusiasts to tailor their systems precisely to their needs and preferences without breaking the bank.</p>

            <h3>Computers are like Cars</h3>
            <p>I'm driven by the thrill of transforming PCs into personalized powerhouses, much like fine-tuning a car engine to perfection. Just as I've always had a passion for customizing cars for peak performance, I bring that same enthusiasm and precision to the world of PC building and modding. Whether I'm exploring the latest tech innovations or uncovering unique mods, I'm here to share my journey and insights, empowering you to craft your ideal computing setup. Join me as I navigate this exciting realm, where every tweak and upgrade brings us closer to the ultimate PC experience.</p>

            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>Visitors to Rodz Tech can expect to journey alongside me as I document my experiences with new and old tech, exploring the latest mods and parts. Whether you're a seasoned builder or just starting out, Rodz Tech is your companion in discovering the innovations and techniques shaping the future of PC and tech modding.</p>
